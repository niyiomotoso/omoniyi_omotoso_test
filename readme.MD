1. Question :

Your goal for this question is to write a program that accepts two lines (x1,x2) and (x3,x4) on the x-axis and returns whether they overlap. As an example, (1,5) and (2,6) overlaps but not (1,5) and (6,8)._ \
Solution:Two methods are implemented in function to evaluate both negetive integers and positive integers on x-axis.


2. Question :

The goal of this question is to write a software library that accepts 2 version string as input and returns whether one is greater than, equal, or less than the other. As an example: “1.2” is greater than “1.1”. Please provide all test cases you could think of._\
Solution: 3 functions are implemented in class to evaluate greater, lesser and equal string numbers.

3. Question :

At Ormuco, we want to optimize every bits of software we write. Your goal is to write a new library that can be integrated to the Ormuco stack. Dealing with network issues everyday, latency is our biggest problem. Thus, your challenge is to write a new Geo Distributed LRU (Least Recently Used) cache with time expiration. This library will be used extensively by many of our services so it needs to meet the following criteria:_\
Solution: Cache class which stores maximun of assigned value, when its reaches maximum size removes the oldest value in cache.
